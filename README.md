# Cover Letter Generator

**A simple Python cover letter generator made for fun and profit! (And learning Python!)**

## Using the generator

* Open cfg.py, and enter your name as the 'yourname' variable
* Install docx if you don't have it already (pip install docx)
* Run cvgen.py, answer the questions, and pick the points you want on your letter

## Configuration

Okay, there are a couple of other files to modify/create

* cvtemplate.py - this is the template for the letter, so add your details/flourishes as required
* components\points - this is where you put all your mad skillz. Using the example, create copies for as many points as you like, and adhere to the formatting as per the file. Cvgen expects 3 to be picked, so 3 unique points is the minimum at this stage.
